Project: BUDGETEATER — Meme Token Website (Corruption-Aesthetic Edition)

Overview:
Create a premium-looking, satirical website for the meme token "BudgetEater" ($BRB), themed around corruption, budget holes, tenders, suitcases of cash, and Excel-based fraud. The site should feel like a polished criminal satire — luxurious, ironic, and animated.

Design Aesthetic:
- High-end, sarcastic corporate criminal style
- Color palette: deep navy, gold accents, crimson details, Excel green touches
- Glitchy effects, animated shadows, money particles, burning documents, etc.
- Layout should not follow typical “sections,” instead — make it chaotic, like a hacked website

Structure:
1. Hero Section (fullscreen)
   - Large TITLE: "BUDGETEATER"
   - Subtitle below: “LAUNCHING AT PUMP.FUN 28 MAY”
   - Glitchy animation of the text on hover
   - Interactive Excel cells floating around
   - Background: tropical luxury + budget documents on fire

2. Hover Cursor
   - Replace default cursor with a small suitcase or kotleta icon
   - On hover over titles or buttons, animate a green flash or Excel tooltip popup

3. Interactive Section: “THE TENDER FILES”
   - 5 corrupt stories scrollable horizontally (see below)
   - Each story in an animated retro tender PDF card design
   - Stories appear with stamp-animation: “APPROVED”

4. Hidden Expense Game (Optional)
   - A fake budget Excel appears, user clicks to uncover hidden bribes
   - Clicking wrong cell triggers explosion effect + popup “BRB on Business Trip”

5. Footer Zone
   - Dark, with a broken seal of “Transparency Agency” and flickering lights
   - Links to Twitter, YouTube (optional, currently omitted)
   - Disclaimer in meme style: “This is not financial advice. This is forensic comedy.”

Animations:
- Mouse movement influences document drift in background
- Excel sheet sparkles randomly in sidebar
- Hover on story cards triggers tender stamp & money sound

Corrupt Stories (For “The Tender Files” Section):

1. “The Palm Tree Fiber Optics Incident”  
The government allocated $8 million for “rural internet installation using sustainable palm tree fibers.” The tender was won by a seafood import company. Their final report included a picture of a crab holding a LAN cable. Nobody objected. The internet remains unchanged.

2. “The Kotleta Consulting Group”  
A consultancy called “KCG” received $12.4M to research meatball efficiency for school lunches. Their final report was 3 pages, half of which were memes. They cited a TikTok and charged $180,000 for "team lunches." Every invoice was paid within 24 hours.

3. “The Yacht-as-a-Service Project”  
An ambitious “mobile sea office” initiative was funded to “bring innovation closer to the ocean.” The office? A luxury yacht with no Wi-Fi. It sank during the kick-off party. The CEO said: “We were just trying to think outside the budget.”

4. “Public Transparency Initiative”  
To improve visibility into spending, $5M was spent on a website that only displayed “Access Denied” upon loading. The devs claimed this was a metaphor for systemic obfuscation. It won a design award.

5. “The Excel Prophet”  
An anonymous freelancer named “ExcelGod420” was hired to forecast national budget trends. He charged $4.2M for a single sheet where every formula linked back to his OnlyFans. Despite the odd setup, his predictions were 98% accurate. He disappeared with the money.
